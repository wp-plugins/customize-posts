Edit posts and postmeta in the Customizer. Stop editing your posts/postmeta blind!

== Description ==

The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see. This plugin was birthed out of the Widget Customizer feature-as-plugin project which was merged into WordPress Core in 3.9: as widgets can now be managed in the Customizer, so too should posts be editable in the Customizer as well.

This **Customize Posts** plugin is not to be confused with 10up's [**Post Customizer**](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer) plugin which is a complimentary effort but seeks to address different use cases. The two plugin projects have [opened a discussion](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer/issues/9#issuecomment-43821746) to collaborate where possible.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2.0 =
Initial release on WordPress.org. Key new features:

* Postmeta can now be added, modified, and deleted—all of actions which are fully previewable.
* Grant `customize` capability to authors and editors who normally can't access the Customizer, so they can edit posts there.
* Move the “Customize” admin bar link to the top level, and add one for editors and authors.
* Allow the Page Template and Featured Image to be modified and previewed.
